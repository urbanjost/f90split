.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBf90split\fP(1) is a utility which splits free source form Fortran code
into multiple files, one module or procedure per file. Note that
contained procedures are stored within their parent procedure.
.PP
Each output file contains a single program unit named after the unit,
unless that filename exists.
.PP
If the initial output file name exists a file will be created named
main0001.f90-main9999.f90, or bdta0001.f90-bdta9999.f90. If a file
with that name already exists, it is put in dupl0001.f90-dupl9999.f90.
.PP
\fBf90split\fP(1) also lists on stdout the USE and INCLUDE dependencies
.PP
\fBf90split\fP(1) is not aware of preprocessor directives.
